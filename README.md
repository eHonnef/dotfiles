# My dotfile configuration

My dotfiles configurations, currently I'm using [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) with the latest available kernel `4.18.13-041813-generic`.

### Install script TODO list:

- Add an option in the `.sh` file to install some packages if it's a laptop or pc.
- Check if the system is elementary (packages exclusive to elementary).
- Add texlive.
- Auto install the latest nvidia driver.
- Add the vscode settings files to a folder (or get from gist) and manually put in the correct directories. (can't run an extension from terminal).
- Download and compile flameshot from repository.

### Dotfiles script TODO list:

- Write it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Add the `.bashrc`.
- Add commands in the `init.rc`.
